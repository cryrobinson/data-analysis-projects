# 1. Declare and assign the variables here:
name_of_shuttle = "Determination"
shuttle_speed_mph = 17500
distance_mars_km = 225000000
distance_moon_km = 384400
miles_per_kilometer = 0.621

# 2. Use print() to print the 'type' each variable. Print one item per line.
print(type(name_of_shuttle))
print(type(shuttle_speed_mph))
print(type(distance_mars_km))
print(type(distance_moon_km))
print(type(miles_per_kilometer))


# Code your solution to exercises 3 and 4 here:
miles_to_mars = distance_mars_km * miles_per_kilometer
hours_to_mars = miles_to_mars / shuttle_speed_mph
days_to_mars = hours_to_mars / 24
print(name_of_shuttle,"will take",days_to_mars,"days to reach Mars.")

# Code your solution to exercise 5 here
miles_to_moon = distance_moon_km * miles_per_kilometer
hours_to_moon = miles_to_moon / shuttle_speed_mph
days_to_moon = hours_to_moon / 24
print(name_of_shuttle,"will take",days_to_moon,"days to reach the Moon.")
